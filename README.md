This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to accessing non-existent attributes in HTML elements using JavaScript. The bug occurs when you attempt to use a non-existent attribute as if it were a real attribute after checking for null from getAttribute.  The example shows how accessing a non-existent attribute via getAttribute returns null, but subsequent attempts to use this as if it exists throws a TypeError. The solution shows how to properly check for attribute existence and handle the case where it does not exist before using it, avoiding the TypeError.
